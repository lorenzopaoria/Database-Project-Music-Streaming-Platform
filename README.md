# Music Streaming Platform Database Project

This repository contains the files for a database project that models a music streaming platform. The goal of this project is to design and implement a relational database schema that can effectively store and manage data related to users, artists, songs, playlists, and other essential entities in a music streaming application.

## Project Overview

The music streaming platform database project includes the following key components:

1. **Entity-Relationship (ER) Diagram**: A visual representation of the database schema, showing the entities, their attributes, and the relationships between them.

2. **Database Schema**: The detailed SQL code for creating the database schema, including tables, columns, data types, constraints, and relationships.

3. **Sample Data**: A set of sample data that can be used to populate the database and test the application's functionality.

4. **SQL Queries**: A collection of SQL queries that demonstrate how to perform various operations on the database, such as inserting, updating, deleting, and querying data.

5. **Database Management Scripts**: Scripts for managing the database, such as backup, restore, and optimization procedures.

## Getting Started
